This project is a little notes app. 
The notes are saved locally using the local storage API.
Multpile notes can be created.
The app uses a markdown library to enabe the user to create markdown and the save/ toggle button allows these lists to be saved with markdown applied

It uses Flexbox, CSS transitions and JavaScript


It is  a good application when learning about markup, local storage and how to work with the DOM

It is also an example of a simple CRUD application
